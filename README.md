# Debiasing_Facial_Recognition
Using a DB-VAE, I was able to reduce any bias a classifier would have. This classifier will be able to tell you whether or not you are human, however when an under represented group tried the traditional model, it was not able to identify them as humans. This de-biasing combats that in a simple way.
